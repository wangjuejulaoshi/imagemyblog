Trying to make a pic libraries for my blog
Once using ossfs to mount files from oss to web directory, but performances no good.
my blog will move to https://s.wangjueju.cn, the core website for sharing my private homeschool activities, information, learning resources, and so on.
you are welcome to join my homeschool exchange group and exchange your ideas about homeschool.
Interesting part is, when I applied for a leaving from school for my boys, the guy acused that I have no right to destroy my boys' right of receiving education, the fxxking funny part is that , they called the shit activities in school education. What a shame!
